## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using html, css and javascript to design this simple responsive website.  I use javascript to utilized a little interactivity for the slider at the header page.  

## Optimizations


Better utilization of the pictures, and I want to clean up the footer as the text isn't as clear due to the background image.

## Lessons Learned:

This was an easy project however it was made hard due to the responsiveness from the customer and lack of input.  Although I had autonomy, I had to revised several times after showing it to the customer.  I realized that I had to be assertive in my communication approach to finish the project as the way the client wanted.

## Examples:
